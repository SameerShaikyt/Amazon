# Amazon Clone - E-commerce Web Page Replication
I developed an Amazon clone, a web page replication of the popular e-commerce platform, using HTML and CSS. This project aims to recreate the visual design and layout of Amazon's main page, providing a hands-on demonstration of my front-end development skills.

Key Features:

Visual Replication: Meticulously recreated the design elements, including the header, navigation, product listings, and footer, to closely resemble the Amazon website.
Responsive Design: Ensured the web page's responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes, allowing for an optimized browsing experience.
Product Listings: Displayed products with relevant information, such as images, titles, prices, and user ratings, resembling the presentation style on Amazon.
Search and Filter: Implemented basic search and filter functionality to allow users to refine their product search based on keywords or categories.
Static Pages: Developed static pages like product details, shopping cart, and checkout to showcase the overall flow and user experience of an e-commerce platform.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Structured the web page's content using semantic HTML elements.
CSS: Styled and positioned elements to replicate the visual design of Amazon.
Responsive Design: Utilized media queries and CSS grid/flexbox for responsive layouts.
This Amazon clone project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML and CSS, emphasizing my attention to detail in replicating complex web designs. It showcases my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web pages that closely resemble existing platforms.
